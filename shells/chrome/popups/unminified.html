<p style="min-width: 450px">
  The React build on this page appears to be unminified.
  <br />
  This makes its size larger, and causes React to run slower.
  <br />
  <br />
  Make sure to <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/optimizing-performance.html#use-the-production-build">set up minification</a> before deployment.
