# `react-devtools`

## Why use this?

If you need to debug a React page somewhere other than Chrome on desktop (a mobile browser, an embedded webview, safari, etc), the `react-devtools` package is for you! It is also useful if your app is inside an iframe.

## Usage
1) Add `import 'react-devtools'` to the top of your entry file
```js
import 'react-devtools';
import React, {Component} from 'react';
```

2) Run the react-devtools standalone app.
```
./node_modules/.bin/react-devtools
```

3) Profit!
Make sure that your `react-devtools` import comes *before* your `react`, `react-dom`, or `react-native`
imports.

4) Donâ€™t forget to remove it before shipping to production.

## Advanced
If you need to customize host, port, or other settings, see the `react-devtools-core` package instead.

## Developing

1) `npm run build`
2) `npm start`
3) `npm publish`
